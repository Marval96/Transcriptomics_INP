EXCLUSIVITY ANALYSIS: NON-FA HNSCC GENES IN IMMUNO-ONCOLOGY PANEL
================================================================================

QUESTION: Are the Non-FA HNSCC genes in the Immuno-Oncology panel exclusive or do they also
appear in other Xenium panels (Multi, Brain, Breast, Colon, Lung, Skin)?

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
--------------------
• Total Non-FA HNSCC genes in Immuno-Oncology panel: 163
• Genes that ARE EXCLUSIVE to the IO panel: 60 (36.8%)
• Genes that ALSO appear in other panels: 103 (63.2%)

CONCLUSION:
→ THE MAJORITY of Non-FA HNSCC genes in the IO panel also appear in OTHER panels

Total: 103 shared genes

COMPARISON WITH FA-HNSCC:
------------------------------
• FA-HNSCC genes exclusive to the IO panel: 20 genes
• Non-FA HNSCC genes exclusive to the IO panel: 60 genes
• FA-HNSCC genes shared with other panels: 19 genes
• Non-FA HNSCC genes shared with other panels: 103 genes

→ Non-FA HNSCC has MORE genes exclusive to the IO panel than FA-HNSCC

IMPLICATIONS FOR YOUR EXPERIMENT:
----------------------------------------
• The Immuno-Oncology panel gives you access to unique Non-FA HNSCC genes
• Specifically, 60 Non-FA HNSCC genes would be exclusively
  accessible via the Immuno-Oncology panel
• The other 103 Non-FA HNSCC genes in the IO panel could also
  be studied using other Xenium panels if needed

• TOTAL unique genes of the IO panel (FA + Non-FA): 80 genes
• This represents a significant added value of the Immuno-Oncology panel
