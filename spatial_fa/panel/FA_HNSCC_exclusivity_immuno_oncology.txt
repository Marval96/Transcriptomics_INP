EXCLUSIVITY ANALYSIS: FA-HNSCC GENES IN THE IMMUNO-ONCOLOGY PANEL
================================================================================

QUESTION: Are the FA-HNSCC genes present in the Immuno-Oncology panel exclusive
or do they also appear in other Xenium panels (Multi, Brain, Breast, Colon, Lung, Skin)?

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
--------------------
• Total FA-HNSCC genes in Immuno-Oncology panel: 39
• Genes that ARE UNIQUE to the IO panel: 20 (51.3%)
• Genes that ALSO appear in other panels: 19 (48.7%)

CONCLUSION:
→ THE MAJORITY of FA-HNSCC genes in the IO panel are UNIQUE

IMPLICATIONS FOR YOUR EXPERIMENT:
----------------------------------------
• If you choose the Immuno-Oncology panel, you will have access to FA-HNSCC genes
  that are not available in other Xenium panels
• Specifically, 20 FA-HNSCC genes would be exclusively
  accessible via the Immuno-Oncology panel
• The other 19 FA-HNSCC genes in the IO panel could also
  be studied using alternative Xenium panels if needed
